Dashboard Implementation using the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol involves
creating a network of interconnected devices to transmit and receive data efficiently in real-time.
The dashboard comprises sensors and LPC2129 microcontroller. interconnected via CAN bus. Sensors
gather data such as vehicle speed and temperature and display relevant information on the dashboard.
